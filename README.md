An opensource clone of [Earthcore: Shattered Elements](http://www.earthcoregame.com/).
On the 31st of March 2018, this game was officially abandoned, so it is not possible to play it anymore (not even single player).
I am going to make a small game engine that will use the same in game rules, using es6 and react.
