[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vikkio88/elime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vikkio88/elime)

An opensource clone of [Earthcore: Shattered Elements](http://www.earthcoregame.com/).

On the 31st of March 2018, this game was officially abandoned, so it is not possible to play it anymore, not even single player campaign, as the app will try to connect to a non-existing server.

I am going to make a small game engine that will use the same in game rules, using es6 and react.

Any help would be appreciated.

### Is there any plan to retake this project? As UX/UI and web designer, I think I can help a lot... gchuca@gmail.com
